## 2.4.2 (2019-04-02)


### Bug Fixes

* **CascaderMulti, SelectMulti:** The selected item is supposed to can not be deleted when `canEdit` ([18b8825](https://github.com/livelybone/vue-select/commit/18b8825))
* **Options:** `isMobile` is not defined ([983d7ff](https://github.com/livelybone/vue-select/commit/983d7ff))
